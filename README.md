## 📌 Reason for Using Public Repo

This is a **public repository** by [Surendrakumarpatel](https://github.com/Surendrakumarpatel), and I am using it:
- As a **learning resource** to sharpen my DevOps skills
- To **dockerize and deploy** a fullstack application using `docker-compose`
- For practicing **CI/CD**, container builds, and production-grade setup in a safe, open-source environment
