# This is the Nginx configuration file for serving a ReactVite application. It is designed to be used in a Docker container or on a server where Nginx is installed.
#  It assumes that the Vite application is built and the static files are located in /usr/share/nginx/html.
#  The configuration includes a server block that listens on port 80 and serves the static files.
